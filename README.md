# AT-CB
Toy lightsaber RGB board, no sound.

Main RGB die is always on, secondary die flickers randomly (pin4), and third (pin3) flashes on impact (from pin2).

For use with cheap sound only boards such as Frogsingers or vibration motors in dueling hilts (such as AtomSabers' Lightflux) where space is at a premium.

Most basic implementation of the code uses delay and is included for ease of understanding.
